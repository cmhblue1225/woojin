We focus on fostering creative and convergent engineering talents by strengthening organic convergence education between majors and activating integrated education.\nEducational Objectives\n1Cultivate creative convergence talents leading the 4th industrial revolution\n2Foster global engineering talents with critical thinking, practical skills, and international awareness\n3Nurture engineering talents who can contribute to national industrial development with leadership and responsibility\n4Educate engineering students with sound values and ethics\nDivision of Energy Engineering\nTEL. 031-539-1910,1990\nFAX. 031-539-1910,1990\nIntroduction department\nMajor in Electrical Engineering (1910)  Homepage\nMajor in Chemical Engineering (1990)  Homepage\nDivision of Energy Engineering\nMajor in Electrical Engineering\nMajor in Chemical Engineering\nMajor in Electrical Engineering\n'Electrical Engineering' is an academic field that explores 'electricity', the most convenient form of energy used by humanity, and develops various electrical energy applications across industries.The 'Electrical Engineering Major' teaches majors such as circuit theory, electromagnetism, power system, and power electronics through a systematic curriculum. We strive to improve practical skills through theoretical and experimental courses and various industry-linked education programs. We also operate the Accreditation for Engineering Education Certification (ABEEK) program to cultivate professional engineers and foster electrical engineers who will lead the 4th industrial revolution. Career paths after graduation ◉ Power Engineer: Performs analysis, design, construction, supervision, and maintenance of power systems (generation, transmission, transformation, and distribution). In other words, they operate and manage power generation, transformation, transmission, and distribution facilities and develop new technologies related to power economics and system operation.  - Career Fields · Operation and management of transmission and distribution facilities at KEPCO and related companies · Electricity safety-related work such as electricity safety construction and power system operation and maintenance at power-related public companies · Operating, managing, and maintaining power generation facilities at the 6major power generation public companies (Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power, Korea Central Power, Korea Western Power, and Korea Southern Power, etc.)  and private power plants (Pocheon Power, GS Power, etc.)   ◉ Power electronics and energy conversion engineer: Performs R&D, design, production, test and evaluation, quality control, technical sales, and product planning in power electronics and energy conversion. In other words, they develop and manufacture DC ↔ AC power converters and energy conversion devices such as motors, generators, and transformers.  - Career Fields · R&D, design, production, and quality control at home appliance and industrial power conversion device manufacturing companies such as Samsung Electronics, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, LG Electronics, LS Electric, Hyosung Heavy Industries, and Doosan Heavy Industries. R&D, design, production, and quality control at PCS manufacturing companies for renewable energy (solar, wind, fuel cells, etc.) and energy storage devices. · R&D, design, production, quality control, etc. at automobile and electronic parts manufacturing companies such as Hyundai-Kia Motors, Hyundai Mobis, Ortron, Kepico, Mando, etc.\nMajor in Chemical Engineering\nTo acquire the creative knowledge skills required in the 4th industrial revolution society, we train creative professionals who can learn the hardware and software fields of the IT field and converge with other areas. Students learn to produce hardware and develop software in the IT field, acquire interdisciplinary knowledge between IT technology and other majors, and develop creative works. Career paths after graduation ◉ Fine Chemical Production & Quality Control Manager: Fine Chemicals is a concept that contrasts with basic chemistry, such as oil refining and petrochemicals, and produces raw materials that manufacturers use in various fields, such as automobiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals, by supplying raw materials from the primary chemical industry, and performs the duties of an intermediate producer between essential chemical companies that produce raw materials and manufacturers that make final products. - Career Fields · Lotte Fine Chemical, Kumho Petrochemical, LG Chem, SK chemicals, Daewoong Pharmaceutical, Myungmun Pharmaceutical, etc. · Determining the specifications for research and development, product safety information and prototype engineering samples production, basic research including experimentation and evaluation, exploring product ideas, evaluating ideas, determining productization, decisions, production and sales.  ◉ Chemical Plant-R&D Manager: This career is responsible for hardware, machinery and equipment, manufacturing products, and software, such as design for installation, construction, and maintenance. Additionally, they are responsible for national strategic industries such as power generation and desalination plants, oil and gas plants, petrochemical plants, offshore plants, industrial facilities, and plant equipment. - Career Fields: PM (Project Manager) and R&D jobs in the chemical/process field such as Hyundai Engineering, Samsung Engineering, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hanwha E&C, Samsung C&T, and Daelim Industries, and production and quality jobs at plant production sites.  ◉ Energy manager: Performs duties in energy conservation and efficiency improvement, climate change agreements, and new and renewable energy, and performs duties related to energy and climate change that can respond to changes in the energy environment, such as carbon neutrality. - Career Fields: Design, supervision, and safety-related skills such as 2050 carbon neutrality, building energy saving, and new and renewable energy at Korea Gas Corporation, GS Caltex, S-OIL, Hanwha Energy, etc.\nElectric Vehicle Core Technology Convergence Major (a convergence major with no set enrollment, allowing for minor and dual majors)\nDaejin University cultivates creative talents with the most extraordinary intellect and personality to contribute to developing the nation and human society in the spirit of Faithfulness, Piety, and Conviction. To this end, the 'Electric Vehicle Core Technology Convergence Major' in the Department of Energy Engineering seeks to foster creative and convergent talents who can lead the era of eco-friendly future vehicles, including electric vehicles, with the 6 core competencies (humanity competence, communication competence, creative convergence competence, global competence, innovation competence, and self-development competence). Therefore, we selected the 'Electric Vehicle Core Technology Convergence Major' as the innovation-leading field for the convergence major of the College of Energy Engineering through the relevance of the 4th industrial revolution to the specialized field, community demand analysis, compatibility with the university development strategy, review of strengths, and comparison of external competitiveness.\nClose\nDept. of Architectural Engineering\nTEL. 031-539-1940\nFAX. 031-539-1940\nHomepage\nDept. of Smart Civil and Environmental Engineering\nTEL. 031-539-2020\nFAX. 031-539-2020\nHomepage\nDept. of Industrial & Data Management Engineering\nTEL. 031-539-2000\nFAX. 031-539-2000\nHomepage\nDept. of Semiconductor Convergence Engineering\nTEL. 031-539-1900\nFAX. 031-539-1900\nHomepage\nDept. of IT Mechanical Engineering\nTEL. 031-539-2030\nFAX. 031-539-2030\nHomepage\nDivision of Engineering Liberal Studies\nTEL. -\nFAX. -\nHomepage\nKOREAN\nBRIEF HISTORY\nCAMPUS MAP\n유튜브\n페이스북\n인스타\n블로그\nMain campus sites\n공동기기센터\n공자아카데미\n공학교육혁신센터\n과학영재교육원\n교수학습지원센터\n교직과\n국제교류원\n글쓰기센터\n교육방송국\n대진대신문사\n대진지역상생센터\n대진평화통일교육연구원\n대학원\n대학일자리플러스센터\n대학혁신지원본부\n문화예술교육원\n박물관\n발전기금\n산학능력개발원\n산학협력단\n산학협력협의체\n상생나눔\n생활관\n숙박시설예약\n성평등상담소\n예비군연대\n원격교육지원센터\n융합전공지원센터\n인권센터\n인성교육원\n입학 홈페이지\n정보전산원\n중앙도서관\n총동문회\n총학생회\n탄소중립지원센터\n통일교육선도대학사업단\n학군단\n학생생활상담센터\n한국어교육센터\n한국접경지역통일학회\nDMZ연구원\nIT융합지식재산교육센터\nDUCC\n그룹웨어\n포털대진\n전자출결\nDJ-MOOC\nibook\nT-WIN\nU-Campus 시스템\n원격지원\nDepartment website\n상생교양대학\n상생교양대학\n대순종학대학\n대순종학과\n인문예술대학\n영어영문학과\n역사·문화콘텐츠학과\n문예콘텐츠창작학과\n현대미술전공\n만화게임그래픽전공\n시각디자인학과\n산업디자인학과\n영화영상학과\n연기예술학과\n실용음악학과\n글로벌산업통상대학\n글로벌경제학과\n경영학과\n국제통상학과\n일본학전공\n국제지역학전공\n중국학전공\n공공인재대학\n공공인재법학과\n행정정보학과\n사회복지학전공\n아동심리교육전공\n미디어커뮤니케이션학과\n문헌정보학과\n보건과학대학\n의생명과학전공\n에코응용화학전공\n간호학과\n스포츠건강과학과\n식품영양학과\n보건경영학과\nIT융합대학\n스마트모빌리티전공\n컴퓨터공학전공\nAI융합학부\n전자공학과\n기계공학과\n스마트융합보안학과\n공과대학\n전기공학전공\n화학공학전공\n신소재공학과\n산업경영공학과\n건축공학전공\n건축학전공\n토목공학전공\n스마트시티전공\n환경에너지공학전공\n국제협력대학\n한국학과\n국제경영학과\n미래평생교육융합대학\n휴먼케어평생교육학과\n사회복지상담학과(야)\nDaejin University, 1007, Hoguk-ro, Pocheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, 11159, Korea / TEL : 031-539-1114 · FAX : 031-539-1115 · Webmaster@daejin.ac.kr\nCOPYRIGHT (C) DAEJIN UNIVERSITY.
